// Client side vs Server side

// client side is the user agent: this is what our user is going to see
// Server side is the part under the hood that is either getting or sending some data 


// Request/Response flow is sthe communication between the client and server. Client will send a request to the server, server will respond with a successful response, or a failed response

// If successful, we're getting some data back. If it failed, we're getting some response telling us what went wrong


// Making requests to the server and handling the responses received

// Today we are just retreiving resources from our server: db.json


// What do we need to request data from a location 

// 1. Endpoint: the URL we want to request data from
// Endpoint we are using is: http://localhost:3000/characters
// 2. The HTTP verb: the type of request we are making. GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE

// use a method to make a request to the server: 

// fetch(): method that belongs to the window
// fetch by default will always make a GET request

const getPokemon = () => {
  // structure of a fetch()
  // fetch is asynchronous
  // What is asynchronous? it means the next bits of code can run while this function continues to complete 
  fetch("http://localhost:3000/characters") // return value of this method call will be a promise object
  // we handle the promise reponse with a .then, we are going to take the response and turn into an object
  .then(resp => resp.json()) // return another promise
  .then(characters => {
    // handle this array of characters so that each character renders to the DOM
    characters.forEach(renderPokemon)
    // characters.forEach((character) => renderPokemon(character))
  })
